### A stupid little cli game for learning Java abstract classes ðŸ˜²

The game consists of two rabble rousers: the mystical Wizard and the barbaric Fighter, who take turns on clobbering each other.
They are named after their ancient forefathers, the Dudes. They hold on to their family traditions and come the first full moon of the year
**'tis clobbering hour.**

TODO: Fighter class too OP, wins every game with almost no damage. Wizard git gud. Oh wait you can't you have no useful spells :( ~~Only a thundering fool would not give him any useful spells whatsoever.~~ Also at the moment you cant actually play the game, but you can still watch the two characters **intensely** battling each other.
